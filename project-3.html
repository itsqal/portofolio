				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Project Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Clipzo Manager is an internal web-based management system developed as a freelance project
					for a local barbershop in Bandung. The client needed a centralized system to manage daily
					operations, including financial records, service catalogs, and overall business performance
					monitoring.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary goal of this project was to deliver a reliable and usable solution in a short
					timeframe while ensuring that the system could support real operational workflows. Until today,
					the system is still actively used in production.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Business Problem</h3>
				<p>
					Before Clipzo Manager, most operational activities were handled manually or through scattered
					tools. This caused difficulties in tracking revenue, monitoring employee performance, and
					maintaining consistent operational data.
				</p>
				<p>
					The barbershop also required integration with an existing HRIS system to manage employee
					and capster data, making system interoperability a key requirement.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Challenges</h3>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
					<li>Delivering a complete and usable system under tight deadlines.</li>
					<li>Translating non-technical business requirements into clear technical specifications.</li>
					<li>Designing a system that could integrate with an external HRIS platform.</li>
					<li>Ensuring the application was stable, secure, and ready for real operational use.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Technical Approach</h3>
				<figure class="my-6 flex justify-center bg-white p-4">
					<img src="assets/project3/clipzo_system_architecture.png" alt="System Architecture Diagram">
				</figure>
				<p>
					I designed and implemented the system as a full-stack web application using Laravel
					and PostgreSQL. Laravel was chosen for its robustness, ecosystem maturity, and ability to
					deliver features quickly without sacrificing maintainability.
				</p>
				<p>
					The system architecture was designed around modular services, allowing financial data,
					catalog management, and employee records to be handled independently while remaining
					connected through a unified backend.
				</p>

				<p>
					For deployment, the application was manually deployed to a VPS environment with a custom domain.
					This involved server configuration, database setup, environment hardening, and ongoing
					maintenance to ensure system reliability.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Results & Impact</h3>
				<p>
					The final system enabled the barbershop to monitor revenue streams, manage service catalogs,
					and track employee-related data from a single platform. Operational visibility improved
					significantly, allowing the business owner to make more informed decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project also marked an important milestone in my development as a software engineer,
					as I independently handled the full project lifecycle, from requirement gathering to deployment
					and post-launch support.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Lessons Learned</h3>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
					<li>Clear communication with non-technical stakeholders is critical to project success.</li>
					<li>Fast delivery does not have to compromise system structure and maintainability.</li>
					<li>Building software that is actually used in production requires a strong focus on reliability.</li>
					<li>Understanding business context is just as important as technical implementation.</li>
				</ul>
